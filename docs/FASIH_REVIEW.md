# Fasih review handoff — read this first (Claude / human)

Paste into Claude: *You are assisting Fasih on CIM. Read `docs/FASIH_REVIEW.md`, then `CONTEXT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, and this PR’s diff. Review only joint / border items listed below. Do not merge without Fasih’s explicit OK. Do not invent Hamza-side MCP work.*

## Remotes (both must stay in sync)

| Remote | URL |
|--------|-----|
| `origin` (day-to-day + PRs) | https://github.com/HamzaFarooq3333/Final_Year_Project |
| `org` (committee home) | https://github.com/ContinuousIntegrityMonitor/Final-Year-Project |

After review comments, Hamza dual-pushes. Same CI workflows on both (`ci-push`, `merge-gate`).

---

## Working rules (do not weaken)

1. **Territory:** `src/cim/mcp/` = Hamza sole; `src/cim/skills/` = Fasih sole; `src/cim/common/**` = border (both review).
2. **CODEOWNERS** matches that split (`/src/cim/common/schema/` both; store is under `common/` → joint).
3. **Branches:** `tXX-slug`; PR title `T-XX: …`; no force-push to `main`.
4. **No Cursor / AI co-author trailers** on commits.
5. **Progress truth:** `progress/tasks/T-XX.md`. History interpretation: `history/entries/`.
6. **T-06 must not merge to `main` until Fasih reviews and approves** (even if CI is green).
7. **FYP I (ADR-003):** functional MCP SEE path by ~1 Dec; product polish deferred to FYP II.
8. Stacked Hamza work (T-07+) may live on branches that include T-06 **without** merging #163 early.

## What to review now (JOINT — your action)

### Priority 1 — T-06 baseline store (blocker)

- **PR:** https://github.com/HamzaFarooq3333/Final_Year_Project/pull/163  
- **Branch:** `t06-baseline-store` (also mirrored on `org`)
- **Owner:** impl Hamza, **review Fasih** (plan: joint design, H implements, F reviews)

**Files to inspect**

| Path | Why |
|------|-----|
| `src/cim/common/store/baseline.py` | Append-only SQLite WAL API |
| `src/cim/common/chain.py` | `record_hash = SHA256(prev \|\| kind \|\| canonical_json)` |
| `src/cim/cli.py` (`verify-chain`) | CLI surface both sides will use |
| `tests/common/test_store.py` | Acceptance evidence |
| `progress/tasks/T-06.md` | Status checklist |

**Review checklist (pass/fail)**

- [ ] No update/delete API or DDL path for mutating historical rows
- [ ] Tamper (edit or delete row) fails `verify_chain` with a clear `broken_at`
- [ ] Genesis prev-hash is 64 zero hex digits; payloads use `canonical_json` (no floats)
- [ ] 10k appends under 5s test is honest (same process, real inserts)
- [ ] Skills-side can reuse this store later for T-08 without schema surprises
- [ ] CLI `cim verify-chain --db` exit codes: 0 ok / 1 broken

**If approved:** comment approve on #163; Hamza merges (or you merge) to `main`, then dual-push.  
**If changes needed:** comment concrete diffs; Hamza fixes on the same branch.

### Priority 2 — Contract / schema border (already on `main`)

Only re-open if T-06 or T-07 forces a schema change:

- `src/cim/common/schema/mcp.py` — `McpArtefactPayload`, digests
- `src/cim/common/schema/canonical.py` — hashing rules
- Any new fields required by inventory/proxy → **both must review** before merge

### Priority 3 — Your sole path (not blocking T-06 merge)

| Task | Status | Your next |
|------|--------|-----------|
| T-05 skills lab / corpus | IP (skeleton PR #6 on main) | Finish runner + corpus acceptance |
| T-08 skills artefact inventory | Blocked on T-06 (+ T-05) | After #163 merges, mirror T-07 pattern for skills |
| T-10 / T-11 | Later | After T-08 |

---

## What Hamza is doing in parallel (NOT waiting on merge)

Per ADR-003 / critical path: **T-07 MCP artefact inventory** (then **T-09 proxy**) stacked on the T-06 branch so Dec C1–C2 can move while you review.

| Task | Territory | Needs your review? |
|------|-----------|--------------------|
| T-07 MCP inventory | Hamza sole (`src/cim/mcp/`) | Only if it changes `common/schema` or `common/store` API |
| T-09 MCP proxy | Hamza sole | Same — review store/schema touch only |
| T-12 rug-pull | Hamza sole | After T-07+T-09 |

You do **not** need to approve T-07/T-09 implementation detail in `mcp/` before T-06 lands. Glance at PRs for accidental `common/` edits.

---

## FYP I December bar (shared)

Must show MCP SEE path: **T-04 lab → T-06 store → T-07 inventory / T-09 capture** toward C1–C5.  
Skills half (T-08+) strengthens C1/C4 but polish and full behavioural path can trail if needed (ADR-003).
