## Working rules (stable)

- Territory: `src/cim/mcp/` = Hamza; `src/cim/skills/` = Fasih; `common/` = joint (PR + both review).
- Branches: `tXX-slug`; PR titles: `T-XX: …`; no force-push to `main`.
- No Cursor / AI co-author trailers on commits.
- Progress truth: `progress/tasks/T-XX.md`; history: `history/entries/`.
- Agent skills for this workspace: copied under `.agents/skills/` (gitignored bodies); names listed in `docs/SKILLS_MANIFEST.txt`.
- Joint review queue for Fasih / Claude: [`docs/FASIH_REVIEW.md`](docs/FASIH_REVIEW.md).
- Do not merge T-06 (#163) until Fasih approves; Hamza may stack T-07/T-09 on the T-06 branch.
